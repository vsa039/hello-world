    ### 
    Files in Git repo can be in two states: tracked or untracked.
    When a file is first added to a repo, they're all untracked; need to stage them (i.e. add them to staging environment)
    Whenever a milestone is reached, files should be added t o a Staging Environment.
    staged files are files ready to be committed to the repository you are working on.
    * adding commits keep track of progress and changes as we work. 
    * git considers commit a change point or "save point". it is a point in project you can go back to if you find a bug, or want to make a change
